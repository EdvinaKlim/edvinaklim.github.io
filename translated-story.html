Trigger warning: this text contains themes of suicide, mental illness.
</p>
<p>
For a few years I had been visiting one of the best psychotherapists in Lithuania. She was someone who helped several people with anorexia get back on their feet. This gave me hope as anorexia is clinically one of the most dangerous and most fatal mental illnesses. The years of therapy were difficult. During that time we worked intensively with my anxiety, constant depression, low self-esteem, golden child syndrome, and many other problems. It seemed that with every visit there would be some new shit that I had to deal with. Bit by bit I started losing hope that someday things will get better for me. If this specialist can’t get me out of this hole, no matter how hard I try, is it even possible for me to get better?
</p>
<p>
Until the current specialist, there were three doctors, psychotherapists, and psychiatrists, who told me that I’m making things up and I need to grow up, that I am an immature child, too young for any serious diagnosis. One of them even told me that I can’t have any mental problems because, in my childhood, my parents were not physically abusive. I have no idea how, from hearing these things, I did not lose my trust in psychiatrists. However, I read lots of stories of luck on the internet. Stories of luck where a person finally finds a suitable doctor and magically heals. Yet, still, I couldn’t get lucky like that.
</p>
<p>
So after those long one and a half years of therapy (two hours per week and at least one hour of work at home every day), my doctor told me: there is a high chance you will not be able to get out of this without medicine. Perhaps you won’t even be able to live. I know it sounds scary, however, it’s not as bad as it might seem. You can get through this. There’s nothing to be afraid of.
</p>
<p>
Those words were said after I had another huge depression episode. Half of the time spent in therapy I would look through the window at that one brick intersection that was different than the rest of the wall. Talking was difficult. Thinking was even worse. I couldn’t remember what it was like getting out of bed without a panic attack, choking on tears. I couldn’t remember what it was like when my head didn’t hurt every day, when I didn’t feel nauseous, and didn’t want to lay down in the middle of the road and never get up.
</p>
<p>
I couldn’t remember what it was like to walk and not think how, if I had the strength, I would jump into the middle of the street in front of a fast-moving car.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks passed after this depression episode. I went to the book fair. The day was fantastic. I met a lot of my friends, bought a bunch of books and others were taking care of me.
</p>
I couldn’t stop crying all the way back home.
</p>
<p>
Not because I had a good time. Because I was in so much pain and I didn’t know why. It was so painful that I wanted to jump out of the window, but I couldn’t get up because my legs felt like they were locked from psychosomatic pain and cramps. Blood tests were ideal, so this pain had been from my constant depression.
</p>
<p>
The other day at home I had my first psychosis attack. I lost my sense of reality. I was delirious, I wanted to kill myself. And I couldn’t get out of bed. For two hours I was slithering in bedsheets, writhing in pain. I said, that damn everything, that I don’t want to live anymore, that everything hurts and I don’t know why. At this time I started manipulating my current partner. He had a wonderful time at the concert on the weekend and I kept telling him that he doesn’t care about me, that he always hurts me, I need help and he acts like an asshole. After that our relationship fell apart indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
A few days later he broke up with me. He said that he couldn’t take it anymore, everything he experienced was pain. He said that during those two years of our relationship he never loved me. Maybe I would have taken it better, maybe not, but my mind was still affected by the psychosis. During the nights I dreamt I was dying. In the mornings I scared everyone, crossed the streets at a red light, and talked the wrong moment and wrong place because I thought I was a corpse. A ghost. A dead spirit walking between the living. Everyone around me was also dead and between the dead – there are no rules.
</p>
<p>
Then the psychosis ended and I had to face reality. And the reality was constant psychological and physical pain, losses, and emptiness. One Friday I came back home. My parents had left for a party. I took several packages of prescribed sedatives and drank two bottles of strong alcohol. No matter how nauseous I was I still smoked a cigarette on the balcony and went to bed. It was so calm that it was funny. The world was getting darker. I was sick but I felt good. Finally, I thought, everything will end. Finally, I will be free.
</p>
<p>
I called my ex-boyfriend and asked him to stay with me on a call until I fell asleep. I didn’t mention anything about dying. I just said that I don’t want to fall asleep alone. He only answered that he doesn’t like calls because they make him anxious and hung up on me.
</p>
<p>
I laughed through tears. Since I am killing myself because everything in life sucks, it’s quite logical that I’m leaving alone. Because what’s the point?
</p>
<p>
I don’t remember when I fell asleep, but I woke up at half-past three in the morning and started vomiting blood and gagging non-stop until almost eleven in the morning. If I remember correctly, I vomited seventeen times. Then just before lunch, I took a nap, and then the hellish week started.
</p>
<p>
I couldn’t walk without vomiting. I couldn’t have even a sip of water because I would start vomiting. I was able to hear my heart whooshing for twenty four hours straight. I was fainting after making every sudden move. After four days I tried to eat rice soup, but I threw everything up. I did not tell my parents that I vomited blood. I only said that I had food poisoning. I still wanted to die.
</p>
<p>
And still, I recovered. After two weeks I was able to eat normal food. I accepted the breakup. I realized that the breakup wasn’t because of the lack of love but because he was cheating on me for months. I was writhing in bed for weeks crying. I was watching TV shows to forget what was happening. And I kept crying. It seemed life had stopped. It ended.
</p>
Back then I did not know that it was not the end of my life, but the end of my rock bottom.
<p>
After my suicide attempt somehow I was dragged to the therapist. I tried to tell them what happened but I lost consciousness before I could finish. Well, not actually. I disconnected from my body. I flew away. As if through the fog, I heard words. Someone was contacting my parents, saying that it is an extreme case and I need to go to a private psychiatric clinic as I have schizophrenia.
</p>
<p>
One and a half years passed after this event. Yesterday I woke up at half-past five in the morning. I was happy like never before. I ran three miles. I calmly smoked and had a cup of coffee. I worked on producing a new song and answered work emails. I was planning to release a new song with a Croatian composer in just a couple of days. During lunch, I got ready for the music festival that I was invited to. In the music workshop, I met a member of the band Colours of Bubbles. We talked about music, the paths of our lives, and work. I contacted the manager. We are ready for a new stage in life – a new album.
</p>
<p>
I stopped wanting to die a year ago. I managed to make my life so much better that I honestly have no words to describe it. I can only say that I never thought that everything could be so much better for me.
</p>
<p>
I never thought that I could be as happy as I am now.
</p>
<p>
So what happened?
</p>
<p>
That’s what this story is all about – “Phoenix pills”.
